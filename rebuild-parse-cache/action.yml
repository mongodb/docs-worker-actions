description: >
  This custom action determines whether or not to rebuild the Snooty parse cache files. 
  It's determined based on the current release and previous release of the docs-worker-pool. 
  The value of the `SNOOTY_PARSER_VERSION` is compared between the two. 
  The value in the Dockerfile.enhanced is used. This should only be triggered by releases for the docs-worker-pool repository.
